# C--
This is homework for a programmin class in C++ that will intergrate python and Jave. 
I decided to upload everything in the off chance someone needs help.
I am using the zybook CS20 Programming Languages.
I am hoping that if any struggling person finds this that it will help. 
I am not the instructor just the student so if anyone has question I do not know how much help I will be. 
Also some of the code will be written just because it has to be.
I will not be adding all of the information from the question just the code.
